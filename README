NAME
    Options - A perl module to provide better support for command-line
    option parsing, hopefully better than GetOpts.

SYNOPSIS
            use Options;
        
        $options = new Options(params => [
                        ['port', 'p', undef, 'The port to connect to.'],
                        ['host', 'h', 'localhost', 'The host to connect to.']
                        ],
                        flags =>  [
                        ['secure', 's', 'Use SSL for encryption.'],
                        ['quit', 'q', 'Quit after connecting.'],
                        ]);

DESCRIPTION
     Create a new instance of the Options class. To do so, pass the constructor
     two optional, named arguments. 'params' are command-line switches with
     arguments, while flags are boolean switches. (duh.)

     Each argument consists of an anonymous array reference which contains
     an anonymous array for each option you wish to support.

     Params arrays must be four elements long, consisting of the long and short
     versions of the switch, a default value, and a description to be printed in
     the usage guide. If the default value is specified as "undef", it becomes a
     required value, and the program will not continue without it. Options without
     defaults can specify the empty string ("") to omit the default.

     Flags arrays are simpler, and omit the default element.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

GETTING OPTIONS
    * $options->get_options()
         This method is called with no arguments, and begins the parsing of
         the global variable @ARGV. When finished, it returns a hash where the
         keys are the long option names, and the values are the result of the
         parse, i.e., strings for params, and boolean values (1 or 0 actually)
         for flag-type options.

         If the parser encounters an unknown flag, or a bare word without a
         recognized switch before it, these are left in the @ARV array in the
         order they are found, so that a script can do additional processing of
         @ARGV.

         If the result is missing a required parameter, the module prints the
         usage table, and exits with a 1 status code.

    * $options->get_result(option)
         Although get_options returns a hash, and that is an
         acceptable way to use the results, this function provides
         some level of convenience when dealing with options that
         may return a reference to a list of results for that option.
         When called in a list context, this will return a list of
         results, even if only one argument was provided.
         However, calling it in a scalar context when there are
         multiple arguments will be, shall we say, disappointing.
